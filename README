- **Ordering system**: Users can select items from the menu, create an order, and send it to the kitchen.
- **Chef management**: A user with chef privileges can manage and track the status of incoming orders.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Django**: Backend framework.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **SQLite**: Default database for development.
